    "Last summer I have been following a 1st MIT course on python programming. Not that I would need this knowledge but as for [Polytechnique courses](https://www.polytechnique.edu/elearning/fr), I like their way to explain knowledge foundations. Teachers from these schools tend to go back to deep roots, and provide clear and somtimes illuminating examples to help us understand concepts."

    "About 6 years ago I have completed a [Probability introduction from Ecole Polythechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/elearning/fr/aleatoire-une-introduction-aux-probabilit%C3%A9s-partie-1). That was great. I had always been hermeticly closed to probability and statistics. For a reason I don't understand, it is not being teached in CPGE (which is a two-or-three-year intensive full-time course preparing top high school graduates for the entrance examination of French engineering and business schools, this is just after high school). It means last time I was exposed to probability was in high school, and probably in engineering school as well but on a light way.\n",
