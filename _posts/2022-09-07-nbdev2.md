fastai has just released [nbdev2](https://nbdev.fast.ai/).

This is a complete rewrite with quarto. I like how they displayed features in that card

# Support

There is a [nbdev section](https://forums.fast.ai/c/nbdev/48) in fastai forum.

There is a channel #nbdev-help at fastai discord. Never posted there.

And [issues page](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev/issues) in github fastai/nbdev repo.



# Walkthrough

There is a 90 min video: [nbdev tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7zS8Ld4_iA&ab_channel=JeremyHoward) -- zero to published project in 90 minutes

I follow here this tutorial.

Here are the big steps:

- create a new project with github: [dataset_tools](https://github.com/castorfou/dataset_tools). Give a description it will be reused by nbdev
- create a local conda env with what is required to develop this library

```bash
conda create --name dataset_tools python=3.9
conda activate dataset_tools 
conda install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=dataset_tools
pip install nbdev
pip install pandas
```

- clone it and turn it into a nbdev repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:castorfou/dataset_tools.git
conda activate dataset_tools
cd dataset_tools
```

* nbdev can be used from here. For example `nbdev_help`  to display all nbdev_ commands and what it does. And more detail can be got with `-h`: `nbdev_new -h`
* `nbdev_new`. It is creating the structure and files such as settings.ini.
* from base environment we can start `jupyter notebook`. It is advised to install nb_extensions (`pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions`), and activate TOC2. Open `00_core.ipynb` with `dataset_tools` kernel. Rename `00_core.ipynb` --> `00_container.ipynb`



# Gitlab integration

because this is the platform we use at Michelin, I will need to make it work with our internal gitlab instance.

There is on-going work to make it happen:

* from Hamel Husain - enhancement request [Support gitlab](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev/issues/945)
* and from fastai community in forum: [Nbdev and Gitlab (source links)](https://forums.fast.ai/t/nbdev-and-gitlab-source-links/98867), [Example: nbdev on Gitlab](https://forums.fast.ai/t/example-nbdev-on-gitlab/98890)
