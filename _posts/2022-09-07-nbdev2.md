fastai has just released [nbdev2](https://nbdev.fast.ai/).

This is a complete rewrite with quarto. I like how they displayed features in that card

# Support

There is a [nbdev section](https://forums.fast.ai/c/nbdev/48) in fastai forum.

There is a channel #nbdev-help at fastai discord. Never posted there.

And [issues page](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev/issues) in github fastai/nbdev repo.



# Walkthrough

There is a 90 min video: [nbdev tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7zS8Ld4_iA&ab_channel=JeremyHoward) -- zero to published project in 90 minutes



I follow here this tutorial.



# Gitlab integration

because this is the platform we use at Michelin, I will need to make it work with our internal gitlab instance.

There is on-going work to make it happen:

* from Hamel Husain - enhancement request [Support gitlab](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev/issues/945)
* and from fastai community in forum: [Nbdev and Gitlab (source links)](https://forums.fast.ai/t/nbdev-and-gitlab-source-links/98867), [Example: nbdev on Gitlab](https://forums.fast.ai/t/example-nbdev-on-gitlab/98890)
