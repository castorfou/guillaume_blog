## Week 40 - October 21

**Monday 10/4**

Jupyter Lab is now packaged as a [desktop app](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab_app). Gave a try 2 minutes but [issue](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab_app/issues/228) with my running environment 

To do: read and handson [Understanding Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-variational-autoencoders-vaes-f70510919f73)

To do: reand and handson [Patsy: Build Powerful Features with Arbitrary Python Code](https://towardsdatascience.com/patsy-build-powerful-features-with-arbitrary-python-code-bb4bb98db67a)

**Thursday 10/7**

> Deep learning seems unstoppable! I'm particularly impressed by the recent progress of deep learning on tabular data. This new survey paper provides an overview of the SOTA deep learning methods on tabular data. A great read for students and practitioners.

## Week 42 - October 21

**Wednesday 10/20**

Using [fastai forums](https://forums.fast.ai/search?q=vae) to get inspirational content for VAE with tabular data. This one sounds good: [Adversarial Autoencoders (with Pytorch)](https://blog.paperspace.com/adversarial-autoencoders-with-pytorch/). And this talk [demystifying bayesian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0S6HFdPtlA&ab_channel=PyData) stuff.

> "Most of human and animal learning is unsupervised learning. If intelligence was a cake, unsupervised learning would be the cake [base], supervised learning would be the icing on the cake, and reinforcement learning would be the cherry on the cake. We know how to make the icing and the cherry, but we don't know how to make the cake."
