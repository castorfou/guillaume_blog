## Week 35 - September 21

**Thursday 9/2**

Paper reviewed on *arxiv* about **Continuous Control With Deep Reinforcement Learning**. (Lillicrap et. al - 2015) [arXiv:1509.02971](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971). This is about DDPG. Initial [paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/silver14.html) comes from David Silver: *Deterministic policy gradient algorithms* in ICML 2014, but is not easy to read. Here is a [review from towardsdatascience](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-deterministic-policy-gradients-explained-2d94655a9b7b), in which the Deep Deterministic Policy  Gradients (DDPG) is presented, and is written for people who wish to  understand the DDPG algorithm.

## Week 36 - September 21

**Monday 9/6**

Install of [barrier](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier/releases) to share keyboard/mouse between linux and windows. Nice combinaison with [KVM usb switch](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B08NSXXY1L/).

Move wsl to another drive with [move-wsl](https://github.com/pxlrbt/move-wsl)

**Wednesday 9/8**

Creation of [custom gym environment](https://github.com/castorfou/handson_stablebaselines3/blob/main/gym_handson/01%20-%20Create%20custom%20gym%20environments%20from%20scratch%20.ipynb) and optimization using DQN, then DDPG with [stable baselines 3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3). Takes around 50,000 steps to optimize a ultra simple grid problem... No success with DDPG, something missing?

**Thursday 9/9**

Still [playing](https://github.com/castorfou/handson_stablebaselines3/blob/main/gym_handson/01%20-%20Create%20custom%20gym%20environments%20from%20scratch%20.ipynb) with gym and stable baselines 3. A2C, PPO and SAC are working but DDPG and TD3 are not (and I don't know why)

## Week 38 - September 21

**Monday 9/20**

Back to Aniti [RL virtual school](https://rlvs.aniti.fr/rl-fundamentals.html). Looking for material to be used to explain RL to my colleagues, and how to properly describe the experience I am running with gym.

Certainly will start lectures from deepming: [2021 DeepMind x UCL RL Lecture Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCCjZe0y4Qc)

**Thursday 9/23**

Start [plotly course](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-data-visualization-with-plotly-in-python) from datacamp using my [datacamp learning process](/guillaume_blog/blog/Datacamp.html). I need basic interactivity and 3d plots to illustrate reward functions.
