## Week 37 - September 22

**Thursday 9/15**    
Played a lot with [nbdev2](/guillaume_blog/blog/nbdev2.html). Most thinks work now with gitlab. That's great
    
**Friday 9/16**
Hamel just announced that [fastpages will be discontinued](https://forums.fast.ai/t/fastpages-deprecating-fastpages-in-favor-of-quarto/99095) as nbdev+quarto is now a valid option to provide a blogging platform.
He has written a [migration guide](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/blogging.html) for that. Will have to follow that.
