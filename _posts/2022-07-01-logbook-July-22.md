## Week 26 - July 22

**Friday 7/1**

* continue [deep rl class](/guillaume_blog/blog/deep-rl-class-with-huggingface.html) with unit 4, <u>unity ml agents within huggingface</u>. And there is a link to a page explaining [decision transformers](https://huggingface.co/blog/decision-transformers). Seems quite powerful and could be useful for me.



## Week 27 - July 22

**Wednesday 7/6**

* continue [deep rl class](/guillaume_blog/blog/deep-rl-class-with-huggingface.html) with unit 5, <u>Policy Gradient with PyTorch</u>



## Week 29 - July 22

**Thursday 7/21**

* I would like to host kaggle-like competitions. I have found [EvalAI](https://github.com/Cloud-CV/EvalAI) which could be an option. I could push a competition for my data manufacturing colleagues and for other areas in my company. There is a [comparison](https://github.com/Cloud-CV/EvalAI/tree/202001b582fdc332a062b85c02be228c3dcf2cd2#platform-comparison) with other kind of platforms (both closed and open sourced)
* ~~installing [rancher desktop](https://dev.michelin.com/wsl2/docker-rancher) to test EvalAI~~ I don't have administrator rights anymore, so I have moved to installing [docker in WSL](/guillaume_blog/blog/install-docker-on-WSL.html).

**Friday 7/22**

* based on my docker in WSL installation, I tried to follow [EvalAI](https://github.com/Cloud-CV/EvalAI) instructions. It fails at docker-compose build phase. I have opened a [ticket](https://github.com/Cloud-CV/EvalAI/issues/3775).
