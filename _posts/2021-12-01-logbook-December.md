## Week 49 - December 21

**Thursday 12/9**

A deep learning course using PyTorch including Transformers, Generative models and self-supervised learning: [https://deeplearning.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html](https://deeplearning.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html) - [W1D1 - Gradient Descent and AutoGrad](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content-dl/blob/main/tutorials/W1D2_LinearDeepLearning/student/W1D2_Tutorial1.ipynb) done

NeurIPS workshop on RL next Monday. [https://sites.google.com/view/deep-rl-workshop-neurips2021](https://sites.google.com/view/deep-rl-workshop-neurips2021). List of posters is just impressive.

And [best fastai sources](https://github.com/tmabraham/awesome-fastai) compiled by Tanishq Mathew Abraham.

From @paperswithcode, Deep learning models for tabular data continue to improve. What are the latest methods and recent progress? [https://twitter.com/paperswithcode/status/1458433653269205002](https://twitter.com/paperswithcode/status/1458433653269205002)
